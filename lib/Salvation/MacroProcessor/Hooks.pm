# ABSTRACT: Base class for your hooks with implementation of actual logic for L<Salvation::MacroProcessor::Spec>

=pod

=head1 NAME

Salvation::MacroProcessor::Hooks - Base class for your hooks with implementation of actual logic for L<Salvation::MacroProcessor::Spec>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Salvation::MacroProcessor::Hooks>-derived classes are a place for your implementation of actual query execution logic. As L<Salvation::MacroProcessor::Spec> aggregates query parts in a complete query for you, you should then do something with aggregated query by yourself.

For the system to work properly, your hook class should have specific name made using following pattern:

 sprintf( 'Salvation::MacroProcessor::Hooks::%s', $your_class_name )

, where C<$your_class_name> is the name of a class you want to have L<Salvation::MacroProcessor> support.

Your hook will be loaded automatically when it need to be loaded.

If there is B<no> hook for current class, but there B<is> hook for one of parent classes - this hook will be used, so you can define one parent class with L<Salvation::MacroProcessor> support and just inherit this class by other classes so each child won't need to have its own hook.

=head2 Example usage

 package Salvation::MacroProcessor::Hooks::MyClass;

 use Moose;

 extends 'Salvation::MacroProcessor::Hooks';

 no Moose;

=head1 REQUIRES

L<Moose> 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 To be redefined

You can redefine following methods to achieve your own goals.

=head3 check

 $hook -> check( $spec, $object );

Checks if given C<$object> could be selected using this C<$spec>.

C<$spec> is a L<Salvation::MacroProcessor::Spec> instance.

C<$object> is an object representing a single row of data returned by the query.

Boolean value should be returned, C<false> means "skip this object" and C<true> means "yes, this object is what we want".

=head3 query_from_attribute

 $hook -> query_from_attribute( $method_description, $attr, @rest );

Generates query part which needs to be applied to the query to get an object which satisfies specified criteria.

This method will be called if all following conditions are true:

=over

=item class has an attribute (see L<Moose::Manual::Attributes> for more info) which name is exactly the same as the method being described

=item description has no C<query> argument specified

=back

C<$method_description> is a L<Salvation::MacroProcessor::MethodDescription> instance.

C<$attr> is a L<Moose::Meta::Attribute> instance.

C<@rest> is a list of arguments of the same types, conditions and meaning as it is for C<query> argument of L<Salvation::MacroProcessor>C<::smp_add_description> when C<$query> is a CodeRef.

Return value should also be as the one of C<$query> function of L<Salvation::MacroProcessor>C<::smp_add_description>.

=head3 select

 $hook -> select( $spec, $additional_query, $additional_args );

Selects objects using given C<$spec> with a mix of C<$additional_query> and C<$additional_args>.

C<$spec> is a L<Salvation::MacroProcessor::Spec> instance.

C<$additional_query> and C<$additional_args> are both passed in by you or any other developer who will try to make a query. Though both are thought of as ArrayRef's.

C<$additional_query>'s meaning is "some custom query part we need to apply to the query".

C<$additional_args>'s meaning is "some additional custom arguments we need to pass to the method which will then perform a request to complete the query".

Return value will be returned directly to caller which is your custom code issued L<Salvation::MacroProcessor::Spec>C<::select>. Though return value is thought of as L<Salvation::MacroProcessor::Iterator> instance.
